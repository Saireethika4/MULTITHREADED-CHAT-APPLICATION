##This project is a Multithreaded Chat Application developed in Java using socket programming. The system consists of a server and multiple clients that can connect and communicate in real-time. The server handles each client connection using separate threads, enabling multiple users to send and receive messages concurrently.I used java and java sockets in these with several functonlaites likeEach time a new client connects, the server spawns a new thread to handle that client independently.All messages sent by one client are broadcast to all other connected clientsThe server keeps track of all active clients using a synchronized set of output streams and the features used in this task Real-time communication between multiple users.Thread-safe handling of messages .Clean and maintainable code structure using object-oriented principles.Console output showing connections and message flow.The deliverables ChatServer.java and ChatClient.java these used to connect the client to server and handles the client connections and broadcasting.
